Data reader toolbox documentation
---------------------------------

The **mdf_reader** is a `python3 <https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/>`_ tool designed to read data files compliant with a user specified data model.

It was developed with the initial idea of reading data from the `International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) <https://icoads.noaa.gov/>`_ stored in the `International Maritime Meteorological Archive (IMMA) data format <https://icoads.noaa.gov/e-doc/imma/R3.0-imma1.pdf>`_.

The tool has been further enhanced to account for any marine meteorological data format, provided that this data meets the following specifications:

-	Data is stored in a human-readable manner: `ASCII <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII>`_.
-	Data is organized in single line reports (e.g. rows of observations separated by a delimiter like .csv).
-	Reports have a coherent internal structure that can be modelized.
-	Reports are fixed width or field delimited types.
-	Reports can be organized in sections, in which case each section can be of different types (fixed width of delimited).

The mdf_reader uses the information provided in a `data model <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data>`_ to read meteorological data into a python `pandas.DataFrame <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html>`_, with the column names and data types set according to each data elementâ€™s description specified in the data model or **schema**. In addition to reading, the mdf_reader validates data elements against the **schema** provided.

This tool outputs a python object with the following attributes:

1.	A `pandas.DataFrame <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html>`_ (DF) with the data values.
2.	A `boolean pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.bool.html>`_ DF with the data validation mask.
3.	A `dictionary <https://realpython.com/python-dicts/>`_ with a simplified version of the input data model.

The reader allows for basic transformations of the data. This feature includes `basic numeric data decoding <https://realpython.com/python-encodings-guide/#enter-unicode>`_ (base36, signed_overpunch) and numeric data conversion (scale and offset).

Several data models have been added to the tool including the IMMA schema: ``~/mdf_reader/data_models/lib/imma1``.

.. note:: **Data from other data models than those already available can be read, providing that this data meets the basic specifications listed above. A data model can be built externally and fed into the tool.**
